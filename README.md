# GlycoTools

GlycoTools simplifies the processing of glycoproteomic data generated by the Byonic (R) search engine.

## Key Features

* Organization of GlycoPSMs into Glycopeptide, Glycosite, Glycoprotein, and glycan data tables. 
* Filter glycoPSMs by user-defined thresholds.
* Protein inference extended across all data files in an experiment.
* Glycan localization for all N- and O-sites on a peptide backbone.
* Detection of GlycoPSMs that are likely artifacts of in-source fragmentation of a larger glycopeptide precursor.
